 Bootstrap AJAX Form Validation with built-in alerts (success & fail).

No CAPTCHA Spam Filter: Most spam emails will fill out all fields in a form based on the DOM elements on a page without reading the CSS. In this form there is a field called 'formChecker' wrapped in '.form-checker' with 'Display: none' added in the CSS. If this field is filled out a 'return false' is triggered in the JS, causing the email to not be sent.
